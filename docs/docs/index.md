## Description

30llm: Multi-Agent LLM Systems for Collaborative Test Case Generation

This project investigates how Large Language Model (LLM) agents can be used to automatically
generate high-quality software test cases. Traditional automated testing tools struggle with tasks
that require multi-perspective reasoning—such as understanding user intent, exploring edge cases, or
applying domain knowledge. In contrast, multi-agent LLM architectures enable multiple specialized
agents to collaborate, debate, or compete to produce more comprehensive test artefacts.

## Main Goal

The primary goal of this project is to determine whether multi-agent LLM systems can outperform
single-agent or traditional methods in generating comprehensive, diverse, and effective test cases.

## Commands

The Makefile contains the central entry points for common tasks related to this project.
