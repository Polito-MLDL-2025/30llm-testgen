This project investigates how Large Language Model (LLM) agents can be used to automatically
generate high-quality software test cases. Traditional automated testing tools struggle with tasks
that require multi-perspective reasoning—such as understanding user intent, exploring edge cases, or
applying domain knowledge. In contrast, multi-agent LLM architectures enable multiple specialized
agents to collaborate, debate, or compete to produce more comprehensive test artefacts.

## Main Goal

The primary goal of this project is to determine whether multi-agent LLM systems can outperform
single-agent or traditional methods in generating comprehensive, diverse, and effective test cases.

## How to contribute

### **Commit Message and Branch Naming Rules**

1. **Commit Message Format**
    - Use the following format for commit messages:
      ```
      <type>: <short description>
      ```
    - **Types**:
      - `feature` or`feat`: A new feature
      - `fix`: A bug fix
      - `docs`: Documentation changes
      - `chore`: maintenance tasks, repo setup, config, etc.
      - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
      - `refactor`: Code refactoring without adding features or fixing bugs
      - `test`: adding or updating tests.
    - Example:
      ```
      feat: add data preprocessing pipeline
      fix: resolve issue with model training script
      ```
    - Details: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) 

2. **Branch Naming Convention**
    - Use the following format for branch names:
      ```
      <type>/<short-description>
      ```
    - **Types**:
      - `main` or `master`: Stable, production-ready code
      - `develop`: Integration branch for features before release (optional)
      - `feature` or `feat`: For new features or enhancements
      - `fix`: For bug fixes
      - `hotfix`: For urgent production fixes
      - `chore`: For maintenance, build, or config tasks
      - `docs`: For documentation-only changes
      - `refactor`: For code refactoring without behavior change
      - `test`: For adding or updating tests
      - `release`: For preparing production releases
    - Example:
     ```
     feat/add-preprocessing-pipeline
     fix/model-training-bug
     ```
    - Details: [Git Branch Naming Convention](https://conventional-branch.github.io/#specification)
    
    - Branch Flow:
    ```
    main <--- release <--- develop <--- feature
     ^                         |
     |                         |
     └-------- hotfix ---------┘
   ```
### **Jupyter Notebook Usage**

1. **Notebook Organization**
    - Notebooks must be stored in the `notebooks/` directory.
    - Naming convention: `PHASE.NOTEBOOK-INITIALS-DESCRIPTION.ipynb`
        
        Example: `0.01-pjb-data-source-1.ipynb`
        
        - `PHASE` codes:
            - `0` – Data exploration
            - `1` – Data cleaning & feature engineering
            - `2` – Visualization
            - `3` – Modeling
            - `4` – Publication
        - `INITIALS` – Your initials; helps identify the author and avoid conflicts.
        - `DESCRIPTION` – Short, clear description of the notebook's purpose.

### **Code Reusability & Refactoring Regulation**

1. **Refactor Shared Code into Modules**
    - Store reusable code in the `src/` package.
    - Add the following cell at the top of each notebook:

    ```python
    %load_ext autoreload
    %autoreload 2
    ```
